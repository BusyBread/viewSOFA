# viewSOFA
This ZSH script uses the MacAdmins Simple Organized Feed for Apple Software Updates [SOFA](https://github.com/macadmins/sofa) repo to present the data via a swfitDialog UI.

The script will also keep a local version of the fetched data in `~/Library/Application Data/SOFA`, alongside a history file which will be used to track when a newer version has been released.
